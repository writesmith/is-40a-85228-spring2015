## Edward Smith -- http://youtu.be/eOG90Q8EfRo (YouTube Tutorial)

<p>I have to admit that I was initially skeptical of linking to YouTube videos
in this series of recommendation posts. However, last week's video was so 
useful and so impressive, that when another HTML5/CSS tutorial video popped
up in my YouTube recommended videos list, I clicked on it to check it out.
That's how I found this week's recommended link. Two-for-two, YouTube has
provided excellent crowd-sourced instruction that has increased my knowledge
and understanding of HTML5 and CSS layout and design.</p>

<p>In both cases, the videos are the work of folks who maintain tutorial web 
sites, and they are using YouTube not only to share their tutorial videos,
but also to drive traffic to their own web pages. The video I found this 
week is made my a web design agency called 1stWebDesigner. Their presence
on YouTube is designed to raise their company profile and create interest
in their for-sale projects like rockingcode.com, an online course that teaches
you HTML5 and CSS for $97. </p>

<p>In order for this strategy to work, the free tutorial must be so good that 
you are convinced that this person can teach you something, but not so good
that you think they've taught you everything they now. This tutorial fits that
description perfectly. It's a really good one-hour walkthrough were a skilled
designer creates a responsive HTML5/CSS page from scratch in a text editor
while you watch. There are a number of reasons why this is worth your time:</p>

1. You get to watch from the point of view of a skilled person, while the
skilled person uses his tools to do his work. This is a great way to find
out what kind of tools are best for the job. The designer, Christian, uses
a programmer's text editor that gives him text-completion and syntax
highlighting, greatly speeding up his work and making it much easier to 
understand. He is also a careful and thorough developer, properly indenting
code as he goes to make it more readable, and closing tags as he opens them
to reduce the chance of accidentally introducing bugs by forgetting to close
tags.
2. The designer, Christian, talks out loud as he codes, explaining what he is
doing and allowing you to follow along as he reasons through his design choices.
This is often one of the harder skills for a new coder to learn... it's not
all about the syntax and the technical details, it's more about problem
solving and decomposition.
3. Watching the designer type his code from scratch is a great way to learn
about tags and syntax without having to struggle through documentation and
trial and error. Especially when he created his CSS stylesheet, I found 
myself over and over saying, ah-ha! That's how it's done! I still don't know
the proper names of the things he was doing, but I can apply them right
away in my own stylesheets, improving my technique and my syntax. Then, as I
come across the language in my books and in other online tutorials and 
documentation, I will already be familiar and so will learn more quickly.
