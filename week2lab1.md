# Edward Smith - IS40A - Online 24/7 - Week#2, Lab Assignment#1

Here it is--Lab #1. It's a very modest effort. That means I have a lot of room for improvement over the rest of the semester! I decided to make my them all about my dog. That is because Dr. C. must have mentioned three or four time during the [LONG] Overview and Introduction that this would be a good choice. I agreed.

I do like my dog. I like very much that she enjoys sitting next to me on the couch while I do my schoolwork. Dogs are also good for you, as I mention in my web page. Click the link and read the article. The research is interesting.

I created this Web page with Notepad (since I am using a Windows laptop at the moment). This is a very basic tool with no frills. I typed all the HTML tags by hand. I also enjoyed creating a nice tidy page by formatting the text. Even though the tags control the appearance of the page in the browser, nice tidy text when viewing the source in the text editor is pleasing, and makes the source easier to read.

As we proceed through the semester, I will create progressively more complex HTML. I will use CSS to control the appearance and the style of the page.

Finally, I want to mention that I have chosen the "hosting" option that is new this semester. Instead of attaching the HTML file to the Blackboard post, I am hosting the file on Github Pages. I like this because I can use a Git repository to control my text files. Here is the link to my HTML page:
