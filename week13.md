## Edward Smith -- http://javascript.crockford.com/ (JavaScript resource)

<p>JavaScript is arguably the most popular computer language in the world today.
This is because it is implemented in almost every web browser, which means that
almost every computer or mobile device connected to the Internet can run JavaScript.

<p>JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich at Netscape in the mid 1990s. It was not
carefully thought out or planned. It was created quickly and in haste. As a result
there are a lot of rough edges and corners that make it easy to create bad code with
lots of bugs.

<p>Douglas Crockford is a programmer with a long history. He has experience on many 
different platforms in many different languages. He had the brilliant insight to
see JavaScript for what it really is: an opportunity to write code on any device,
and not a bad language, IF you stay away from the bad parts.

<p>He wrote a book called JavaScript, the Good Parts. In this book he teaches you how
to use JavaScript as a real programming language, focusing on design patterns and
programming techniques that use the capabilities of JavaScript in a careful, clean
and sane fashion.

<p>This link is to Douglas Crockford's web site. He has a wealth of resources for
programming in JavaScript. There are many videos, tutorials, and blogs.

<p>Douglas Crockford is also the author of JSON, the JavaScript Object Notation, 
which has been implemented in many programming languages and provides a method of
exchanging data between programs and systems using structured text. This web site
provides a lot of information about JSON too.
