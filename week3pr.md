Thread: Edward Smith - http://learnlayout.com/ (CSS Tutorial)

If you consider yourself to be slightly more than a beginner to the 
HTML/CSS/Javascript game, as I do, then you may know how to write HTML 
code by hand that's reasonably good enough. You might even be able to 
wrangle some CSS class or id selectors well enough to apply some stye 
to the page. But how well do you really know CSS layout? 

This Web site is a CSS Layout tutorial. It steps you through 20 screens,
beginning with plain HTML and following with 19 different CSS concepts 
along with examples. The goal is not to take you from knowing completely
nothing to completely proficient. Rather it's all about filling in the 
gaps by taking you by the hand step by step through the concepts. Once you
click the Get Started button, you can always click the Home button to
get back to the start, or click the Table of Contents button to orient
yourself and see how far along you are, or jump back to a specific 
concept that you need a refresher on or would like to study in more depth.

Although this is not a complete beginner's tutorial, the material is not 
too advanced to be relevant and useful. In fact, the author makes it clear
that he is teaching the fundamentals of CSS, that are used in any website's
layout. The writing style is informal and relaxed, sprinkled with humor. 
The content is also accessible to non-English speakers, having been translated
into a variety of languages.

A benefit of this step-by-step approach is that, although you can jump off
the track and visit any individual topic through the Table of Contents,
the step-by-step track will lead you through a logical progression of
learning, gradually building on material already covered, so that you can
easily and slowly add concepts until you are able to understand and
implement sophisticated layout.
