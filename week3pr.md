## Thread: Edward Smith - http://learnlayout.com/ (CSS Tutorial)

<p>If you consider yourself to be slightly more than a beginner to the 
HTML/CSS/Javascript game, as I do, then you may know how to write HTML 
code by hand that's reasonably good enough. You might even be able to 
wrangle some CSS class or id selectors well enough to apply some stye 
to the page. But how well do you really know CSS layout? </p>

<p>This Web site is a CSS Layout tutorial. It steps you through 20 screens,
beginning with plain HTML and following with 19 different CSS concepts 
along with examples. The goal is not to take you from knowing completely
nothing to completely proficient. Rather it's all about filling in the 
gaps by taking you by the hand step by step through the concepts. Once you
click the Get Started button, you can always click the Home button to
get back to the start, or click the Table of Contents button to orient
yourself and see how far along you are, or jump back to a specific 
concept that you need a refresher on or would like to study in more depth.</p>

<p>Although this is not a complete beginner's tutorial, the material is not 
too advanced to be relevant and useful. In fact, the author makes it clear
that he is teaching the fundamentals of CSS, that are used in any website's
layout. The writing style is informal and relaxed, sprinkled with humor. 
The content is also accessible to non-English speakers, having been translated
into a variety of languages.</p>

<p>A benefit of this step-by-step approach is that, although you can jump off
the track and visit any individual topic through the Table of Contents,
the step-by-step track will lead you through a logical progression of
learning, gradually building on material already covered, so that you can
easily and slowly add concepts until you are able to understand and
implement sophisticated layout.</p>

<p>The tutorial is also aware of the real world. By this I mean that you won't
be learning in a strictly academic context; the tutorial lets you know
that what you're learning is available in all browsers. For example, the 
max-width property is supported on elements in all browsers, including IE7,
whereas, in later steps, the CSS might only work in IE8+. CSS definitely has
warts, and this tutorial doesn't shy away from them. In the case of CSS that
may not display as intended, the author covers strategies, but clearly identifies
them as hacks and explains that they will not work successfully or uniformly
in all browsers.</p>

<p>One of my favorite surprises as I worked through this tutorial is that the
code does not necessarily simply become more and more complex, more and
more hairy as the steps progress inexorably onward. In fact, once a slightly
more complex concept has been explained, it is used to create the exact same
layout from a few screens back, but with much less code. That was very 
refreshing. By the end of the article, however, things became more tedious
when the same layout was recreated repeatedly using a wide variety of 
techniques, and the further along the tutorial progressed, the farther into 
exotic and new territory it strayed. By near the end of the article, we were
being warned that the layout would only work in the newest of browsers (IE9 and
lower are out of luck) and various prefixes are necessary in order to flag
the attention of the various browser engines.</p>

<p>In conclusion, this article was about a CSS Tutorial web site. The tutorial
is not for raw beginners, but is accessible and easy to follow so that 
with some persistence anyone with a little knowledge of how to create a Web
page in HTML will benefit. Also, the tutorial progresses in an orderly fashion
towards more complex material, and is careful to explain if the techinques
being presented are non-standard, are hacks, or only work in some browsers.</p>

<p>I learned a lot. The tutorial clarified issues, refreshed my memory, and got
me on a solid footing to moving toward knowing more about CSS.</p>
