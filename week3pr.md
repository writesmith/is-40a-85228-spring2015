Thread: Edward Smith - http://learnlayout.com/ (CSS Tutorial)

If you consider yourself to be slightly more than a beginner to the 
HTML/CSS/Javascript game, as I do, then you may know how to write HTML 
code by hand that's reasonably good enough. You might even be able to 
wrangle some CSS class or id selectors well enough to apply some stye 
to the page. But how well do you really know CSS layout? 

This Web site is a CSS Layout tutorial. It steps you through 20 screens,
beginning with plain HTML and following with 19 different CSS concepts 
along with examples. The goal is not to take you from knowing completely
nothing to completely proficient. Rather it's all about filling in the 
gaps by taking you by the hand step by step through the concepts. Once you
click the Get Started button, you can always click the Home button to
get back to the start, or click the Table of Contents button to orient
yourself and see how far along you are, or jump back to a specific 
concept that you need a refresher on or would like to study in more depth.
