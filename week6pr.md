## Edward Smith -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gTw2EDkaDQ (HTML5 Tutorial Videos)

<p>This week I'd like to bring your attention to a series of six videos on 
YouTube, titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gTw2EDkaDQ">
HTML5 Tutorial for Beginners</a>. These six videos begin with the very basics.
You are no doubt much further along in your HTML5 learning journey than this,
and don't need instructions on how to download a text editor or preview your
Web page in a browser. But every once in a while I like to take a step back
and listen to someone new explain the beginning concepts to me. Maybe I'll 
hear something explained in a different way that will make different sense or
shed a different understanding on a familiar concept. </p>

<p>The videos work quickly through the basic concepts, and things are explained 
clearly and patiently. If you have a friend who doesn't know anything about
HTML, this would be a good thing to watch with him. Here are the titles of the 
six videos:</p>

1. Getting Started
2. Text
3. Images and Hyperlinks
4. Audio and Video
5. New Semantic Elements
6. CSS Page Layout

<p>You may find that you are more familiar with some of the topics and less
familiar with others. For example, things were very familiar to me in the
first three videos. But the fourth and fifth video covered new elements that 
were not available before HTML5. I was interested in seeing a very basic 
example of adding audio and video to a web page. These simple examples do not
show flashy and complicated work. It's simply the very basics required to get
the example to work. This means you can see what the tag is and what it does.</p>

<p>I have been curious for a while to know how the HTML5 video element works.
I like some of the new web pages I've visited. They have a responsive design
that fills the browser window with content regardless of what device you are 
using to visit. It's especially impressive when the content is a full-window
video that automatically begins playing. This tutorial (specifically video 4)
shows how it is done.</p>

<p>Although the narrator of the tutorial claims that he is not teaching CSS
during these six videos, because he has another series of videos that focus
solely on CSS, the last video in this series of six does show how to lay out
a page using CSS and new HTML5 elements. In a few quick minutes he shows how
it is no longer necessary to use tables to lay out a page. Modern browsers are
able to display HTML5 and CSS quite consistently. With care, you can create a
web page that will display properly and degrade gracefully in the small 
fraction of older browsers that visit your page.</p>

<p>More advanced techniques, like some of the interactive journalism articles
on the New York Times web site, require additional knowledge of CSS and 
Javascript. But this is a good start.</p>

<p>The credit for the videos is given to [Little Web Hut](http://littlewebhut.com/).
I visited the web page and I noticed that there are other tutorials available
too. You can learn more about CSS, Javascript, HTML5, and other topics.</p>
