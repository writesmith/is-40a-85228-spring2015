<p>I found this week's site while searching for more information about HTML
image maps and tables. By the way I think it's kind of funny that we're 
learning about HTML 3.2 technology like old-school image maps in this class.
I thought we'd be spending more time on CSS layout and maybe a little 
Javascript. But that's neither here nor there, here we are learning all about
these things and needing to demonstrate them in fabulous web pages. I used
tables to layout my pages years ago long before CSS divs came along and
made things all clean and modern. Holy cow, tables for layout can get 
complicated and are about as terrible as frames. I hope we don't have to 
learn about frames. I just spent 15 years trying to forget about frames.</p>

<p>But here I was trying to learn about they syntax of what I have to use
in my web page for class this week, and what should turn up in the Google
search results but the Mozilla Developer's Network. It's groovy man. It has
all kinds of useful information on topics of interest for developer types
and aspirants. There are different sections for different technologies. There
is a section for HTML and HTML5. There is a section for CSS and CSS3. There
is a section on Javascript.</p>

<p>I didn't explore the other parts of the Mozilla Developer's Network, such
as the Developer's Tools, which includes a Javascript debugger and a web
console. There is also a place to see and submit demos that looked interesting.
I will have to find some time to go back and look around.</p>

<p>When I found the site in my Google search results, I clicked a deep link
directly into the heart of the site. I found a page on HTML tables. It described
the syntax and showed examples. It also had decent recommendations on what
was good practice and what part of the HTML spec is still good and safe to 
use. I opened the Safari view source view and used the Inspect tool to click
on the examples and then read the code in the source to see how it was 
done. The documentation is very much like API documentation. It's well
done and useful to the developer. I recommend that you check it out.</p>
