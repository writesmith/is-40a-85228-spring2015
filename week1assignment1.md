# Edward Smith - ISA40A - Online 24/7 - Week #1 Assignment #1

Five Important Points from the Syllabus:

1. Regular "attendance" is important even though the class is online. 
2. A minimum level of technical proficiency is expected: there will be no hand-holding or one-on-one assistance in the online class.
3. The student must have access to a recent computer with a good Internet connection and modern browser.
4. Lab time is a requirement of the course. This can be time in an actual school lab, or independent work on a personal computer at home.
5. The Blackboard Calendar is important. The student must check the Blackboard Calendar each week to remain apprised of work deadlines.

My goal for this class is to refresh my knowledge of HTML and CSS, and to be able to create simple static Web sites by hand. I also hope to improve my discipline and ability to work independently at home with no supervision.

I was unable to find anything on Blackboard about the "Success Articles".

I am not a model online student. However, I have demonstrated an ability to meet minimum requirements. I plan to improve this semester. I'm hoping that I'm in the 70% to 80% range.
