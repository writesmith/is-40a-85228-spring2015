<p>Let's pause for a moment to consider what we're doing: We are endeavoring to learn
how to create Web pages using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The end result will be a 
page that someone looks at in the browser. The consumer will be a human being with a 
short attention span. Someone who is easily distracted and has been trained to expect
that, if he cannot find what he wants on your site, it is no matter, because it is so
easy to leave, go back to Google, and try the next search result in the list.</p>

<p>You have a few small precious seconds of time, most of which is taken up by your 
page travelling over a network connection that might be quite slow over the last mile,
in which to make a good impression and convince the browsing human to hang around and
finish reading.</p>

<p>A key point here is that we are designers, and we need to know more than how the 
code works. We need to know how the user interface works, and if it is effective in 
communicating our message. The page I chose this week is part 2 of an article on 7
rules for creating gorgeous user interfaces. Read part 1 by clicking the link at the 
top of the article. This is, as the author states, a guide to visual aesthetics, 
written by a nerd. I like the article a lot--largely because it's very well done and
looks fantastic.</p>

<p>Lots of the advice here is aimed at graphic designers. Folks who spend a lot of
time in Photoshop getting images ready for the Web and overlaying the images with
text. But the rules are for Web page user interface design, and they are applicable
to front-end developers. Folks that feel comfortable with code and making HTML web
pages by hand are often not so comfortable with graphic design, pictures, and "art".
But get this: it's important. It's important enough that you should probably take
your time and spend some effort getting comfortable with it. It's not necessary to 
become an artist, or a designer. It is a good idea though that you get better at 
recognizing what looks good, and what does not look good, and how to make your stuff 
look better. We have a whole semester to grapple with this problem, and it is part of
the learning objectives of this course that we get better and our pages look 
progressively more professional as the semester goes by.</p>

<p>The author of this article, Eric D. Kennedy, is a professional user interface
designer. In the conclusion to his article, he makes the claim that this is not 
rocket science, that this is not magic. Good design is something that is attainable
by ordinary folks (not just designers). His advice is that you take the time to make
your work look good. This is good advice--you will be much more likely to be 
successful at getting folks to read the Web pages you create if they look good.</p>

<p>Clean and simple UI--without needing to attend art school. Perhaps it is important
to remember that less is more--especially when we have to push it through the wire
before the impatient human can read it.</p>
